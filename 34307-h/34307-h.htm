<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br>

<p>Since the appearance of the Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon
Intelligence Scale I have been frequently urged to prepare a
condensed guide which would make the application of the tests easier
and more convenient. I have hesitated somewhat to act upon this
suggestion because I have not wished to encourage the use of the
scale without the supplementary directions and explanations which are
set forth in the original text of the Stanford Revision.<small><small><sup>1</sup></small></small> The
demand has become so insistent, however, that I have decided to heed
it. I have been led to this decision largely by the fact that my
revision is now so generally used by examiners who are sufficiently
experienced to be trusted to follow the correct procedure without the
necessity of constantly consulting the complete text. Those who are
thoroughly familiar with the contents of the latter will find the
<i>Condensed Guide</i> a convenient help. It is impossible, however, to
warn the inexperienced examiner too emphatically against the dangers
inherent in the routine application of mental tests without some
knowledge of their derivation, meaning, and purpose. The necessary
psychological background for the use of the Binet scale I have tried
to supply in <i>The Measurement of Intelligence,</i> and in <i>The
Intelligence of School Children</i> I have explained the practical uses
of mental tests in the grading and classification of school children.
It is only as a supplement to these books that the procedure of the
Stanford Revision is here presented in abbreviated form.</p>

<blockquote><small><small><sup>1</sup></small> Lewis M. Terman: <i>The Measurement of Intelligence</i>.
(Riverside Textbooks in Education.) Houghton Mifflin Company.</small></blockquote>

<p>For the further aid of the experienced examiner a condensed record
blank has also been prepared. Although this is considerably cheaper
than the original Record Booklet and in certain respects perhaps
somewhat more convenient, it is not recommended as a satisfactory
substitute except when used by thoroughly trained examiners.
Beginners, at least, should continue to use the complete Record
Booklet both because of the accuracy of procedure which it fosters
and because of the advantages of having a complete verbatim record of
the responses. Besides being indispensable for the analytical study
of the child's mental processes, the complete record makes possible
the correction of errors in scoring and permits interesting
qualitative comparisons between earlier and later performances by the
same subject. It is believed that only for the veteran examiner, and
perhaps even then only in special cases, are these advantages
outweighed by the lower cost of the abbreviated blank.</p>

<p>The labor of preparing this <i>Guide</i> was made considerably lighter
than it would otherwise have been by the fact that a similar guide
had been prepared in the Office of the Surgeon-General for use in the
army. I am greatly indebted to Dr. J. W. Bridges and to Major H. C.
Bingham for assistance in the preparation of the latter. Their
careful work has saved me many hours and has doubtless made the
<i>Condensed Guide</i> more accurate and serviceable than it could
otherwise have been.</p>

<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS</h3>
<br>

<p>General directions for the use of the Stanford Revision have been
fully set forth in chapter <small>VIII</small> of <i>The Measurement of Intelligence</i>.
As this guide is only a handbook of procedure for the tests
themselves, I shall not here undertake either to summarize that
chapter or to add to it. I trust it may safely be assumed that no
responsible person will attempt to apply the tests who is not
familiar with the book which explains them and presents the general
considerations which should govern their use.</p>

<p>However, extended observation of the difficulties which students and
teachers encounter in learning to use the Stanford Revision has
taught me that there are certain injunctions which cannot easily be
too often repeated. Among these the following "ten commandments" have
been selected for reëmphasis here:</p>

<p>1. The subject's attention and coöperation must be secured. Thanks to
the novelty and inherent interest of the tests, this is usually not
difficult to do. But there are degrees of <i>rapport,</i> and the examiner
should not be satisfied with his efforts until the subject becomes
wholly absorbed in the tasks set him by the tests. The importance of
tactful encouragement and a kindly, genial manner cannot be too
strongly emphasized, nor, on the other hand, the risk incurred in
allowing a parent to witness the test. Hardly anything is more likely
to spoil an examination than the presence of a critical or
over-sympathetic parent. Sometimes the teacher's presence is hardly
less objectionable.</p>

<p>2. The correct formulas should be thoroughly learned and strictly
adhered to. Unless this is done the scale used is not the Stanford
Revision, whatever else it may be. For the first fifty or hundred
examinations the tests should be given directly from this guide.
Little by little, as the procedure becomes memorized, the examiner
should attempt to free himself of the necessity of reading the
formulas, but for a long time it is necessary to check up one's
procedure by frequent reference to the Guide if practice in error is
to be avoided.</p>

<p>3. The examiner should early learn to withstand the temptation of
wholesale coaxing and cross-questioning. To do so often robs the
response of significance and is likely to interfere with the
establishment of <i>rapport</i>. A simple "What do you mean?" or, "Explain
what you mean," is sufficient to clarify most answers which are not
clear. At the same time the examiner should be on guard against
mistaking exceptional timidity for inability to respond. Persuasive
encouragement is frequently necessary, but this should not be allowed
to degenerate into a chronic habit of coaxing.</p>

<p>4. The record should always be made as the test proceeds. Memory
should never be trusted. As a rule enough of each response should be
recorded to enable one to score it at any time later. The great
advantage of the Record Booklet is that it permits this. Only the
most expert examiner should limit his record to pluses and minuses.</p>

<p>5. The examination should be thorough. It should include at least one
year in which there is no failure and at least one year in which
there is no success. When lack of time necessitates an abbreviation
of the examination, this should be done by using only the starred
tests rather than by shortening the range of the examination.</p>

<p>6. Success in alternative tests may not be substituted for failure in
one of the regular tests. Ordinarily the alternatives should be
omitted. They have been included in the scale chiefly as a
convenience in case materials are lacking for any of the regular
tests, or in case any of the latter should be deemed for some special
reason unsuitable. The ball and field test, for example, is often
rendered unsuitable by coaching, and one of the alternates should
always be substituted for the vocabulary test in the case of subjects
whose mother tongue is other than English. Other substitutions or
omissions are necessary in the case of subjects who are illiterate.</p>

<p>7. Care should be taken to ascertain the correct age. This is often
misstated both by young normal children and by defectives. The age
should be recorded in years <i>and months</i>.</p>

<p>8. In ordinary calculation of the intelligence quotient without any
mechanical aid (as slide rule, calculating chart, or table), both age
and mental age should be reduced to months before dividing.</p>

<p>9. <b>To avoid the danger of large error it is absolutely essential that
the adding of credits to secure mental age and the dividing of mental
age by chronological age to secure the intelligence quotient be
performed twice.</b></p>

<p>10. Finally, in calculating the intelligence quotient of subjects who
are more than sixteen years old, the chronological age should be
counted as sixteen. It is possible, as certain army data suggest,
that a lower age than sixteen should have been taken, but until the
matter has been more thoroughly investigated by the use of unselected
adult subjects the age sixteen will continue to be used in the
Stanford Revision.</p>

<p>Say, <b>"Now I am going to show you a pretty picture."</b> Show picture
(<i>a</i>) and say, <b>"Tell me what you see in this picture,"</b> or, <b>"Look at
the picture and tell me everything you can see in it."</b> If no
response, <b>"Show me the &mdash;&mdash;." "That is fine: now tell me everything
you see in the picture."</b> If necessary ask, <b>"And what else?"</b> Same for
pictures (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p>Credit if at least three objects in one picture are enumerated
spontaneously, or if one picture is described or interpreted.</p>
<br>

<p><b>4. <i>Giving Sex</i></b></p>

<p>If S. is a boy, <b>"Are you a little boy or a little girl?"</b> If S. is a
girl, <b>"Are you a little girl or a little boy?"</b> If no response, <b>"Are
you a little girl?"</b> (if a boy); or <b>"Are you a little boy?"</b> (if a
girl). If answer is "No," say, <b>"Well, what are you? Are you a little
boy or a little girl?"</b> (or vice versa).</p>
<br>

<p><b>5. <i>Giving Last Name</i></b></p>

<p>Ask, <b>"What is your name?"</b> If answer is only first or last name, e.g.,
Walter, say, <b>"Yes, but what is your other name? Walter what?"</b> and if
necessary, <b>"Is your name Walter Smith?"</b></p>

<p><b>1. <i>Comparison of Lines</i></b></p>

<p>Show card (IV 1) and say, <b>"See these lines. Look closely and tell me
which one is longer. Put your finger on the longest one."</b> If no
response, <b>"Show me which line is the biggest."</b> Show twice more
(reversing card at second showing) and ask, <b>"Which one is the longest
here?"</b> If only two out of three are correct, repeat the entire test.</p>

<p>Credit if three responses out of three, or five out of six, are
correct.</p>
<br>

<p><b>2. <i>Discrimination of Forms</i></b></p>

<p>Use the forms supplied with the package of Test Material. One of the
two cards containing the forms is to be cut up, so that the forms may
be placed one at a time on the other card at "X."</p>

<p>Place circle at "X" on card and say, <b>"Show me one like this,"</b> at same
time passing the finger around the circumference of the circle. If no
response, <b>"Do you see all of these things?"</b> (running finger over the
various forms). <b>"And do you see this one?"</b> (pointing to circle
again). <b>"Now, find me another one just like this."</b> A first error
should be corrected thus, <b>"No, find one just like this"</b> (again
passing finger around the outline of form at "X"). Make no comment on
any other errors, but pass on to the square, then the triangle, and
the rest in any order. Commend successes.</p>

<p>Credit for 7 correct choices out of 10. The first error, if
corrected, counts as correct.</p>
<br>

<p><b>3. <i>Counting Four Pennies</i></b></p>

<p>Place four pennies in a horizontal row. Say, <b>"See these pennies.
Count them and tell me how many there are. Count them with your
finger, this way"</b> (pointing to the first one on the subject's
left)&mdash;<b>"One. Now, go ahead."</b> If S. gives number without pointing,
say, <b>"No, count them with your finger, this way,"</b> starting him as
before. Have S. count aloud.</p>

<p>Credit for correct count tallying with pointing.</p>
<br>

<p><b>4. <i>Copying Square</i></b></p>

<p>Show S. the square and say, <b>"You see that?"</b> (pointing to square). <b>"I
want you to make one just like it. Make it right here"</b> (showing space
on record blank). <b>"Go ahead. I know you can do it nicely."</b> Unless
drawing is clearly satisfactory, repeat twice more, saying each time
<b>"Make it exactly like this,"</b> pointing to model. <b>Pencil.</b></p>

<p>Credit if one drawing is satisfactory. Score liberally. (See scoring
card.)</p>
<br>

<p><b>5. <i>Comprehension</i></b></p>

<p>Be sure to get S.'s attention before asking question. Repeat if
necessary. Allow 20 seconds for answer.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>"What must you do when you are sleepy?"</b></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>"What ought you to do when you are cold?"</b></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>"What ought you to do when you are hungry?"</b></p>


<p>Credit if two responses of the three are correct. (See <i>The
Measurement of Intelligence,</i> p. 158.)</p>
<br>

<p><b>6. <i>Repeating Four Digits</i></b></p>

<p>Say, <b>"Listen. I am going to say over some numbers and after I am
through, I want you to say them exactly as I do. Listen closely and
get them just right."</b> Give (<i>a</i>) <b>4, 7, 3, 9,</b> then (<i>b</i>) <b>2, 8, 5, 4,</b>
and (<i>c</i>) <b>7, 2, 6, 1,</b> if necessary. May repeat (<i>a</i>) until attempt is
made, but not others. Rate, a little faster than one digit per
second.</p>

<p>Credit if one set of the three is correctly repeated in order, after
a single reading.</p>
<br>

<p><b>7. <i>Alt. Repeating Sentences</i></b></p>

<p>Say, <b>"Listen; say this, 'Where is kitty?'" "Now, say this, &mdash;&mdash;,"</b>
reading the first sentence in a natural voice, distinctly and with
expression. May re-read the first sentence.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>"The boy's name is John. He is a very good boy."</b></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>"When the train passes you will hear the whistle blow."</b></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>"We are going to have a good time in the country."</b></p>

<p>Credit if at least one sentence is repeated correctly after a single
reading.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Year V</h4>
<br>

<p><b>1. <i>Comparison of Weights</i></b></p>

<p>Place the 3 and 15 gram weights before S., 2 or 3 inches apart. Say,
<b>"You see these blocks. They look just alike, but one of them is heavy
and one is light. Try them and tell me which one is heavier."</b> Repeat
instructions if necessary, saying, <b>"Tell me which one is the
heaviest."</b> If S. merely points without lifting blocks, or picks up
one at random, say, <b>"No, that is not the way. You must take the
blocks in your hands and try them, like this."</b> (Illustrate.) Give
second trial with position of weights reversed; third trial with
weights in same position as first.</p>

<p>Credit if two of three comparisons are correct.</p>
<br>

<p><b>2. <i>Naming Colors</i></b></p>

<p>Show card (V 2) and say, pointing to colors in the order, red,
yellow, blue, green, <b>"What is the name of that color?"</b></p>

<p>Credit if all colors are correctly named, without marked uncertainty.</p>
<br>

<p><b>3. <i>Æsthetic Comparison</i></b></p>

<p>Show pairs of faces in order from top to bottom of card (V 3). Say,
<b>"Which of these two pictures is the prettiest?"</b></p>

<p>Credit if all <i>three</i> comparisons are made correctly.</p>
<br>

<p><b>4. <i>Definitions: Use or Better</i></b></p>

<p>Say, <b>"You have seen a chair. You know what a chair is. Tell me, what
is a chair?"</b> If necessary urge as follows: <b>"I am sure you know what a
chair is. You have seen a chair." "Now, tell me, what is a chair?"</b> If
S. rambles say, <b>"Yes, but tell me; what is a chair?"</b> Same for <b>horse,
fork, doll, pencil, table.</b></p>

<p>Credit if four words out of the six are defined in terms of use or
better. (See <i>The Measurement of Intelligence,</i> p. 168.)</p>
<br>

<p><b>5. <i>Patience</i></b></p>

<p>Use two cards, each 2 x 3 inches. Divide one of them diagonally into
two triangles. Place the uncut card on the table with one of the
longer sides toward S. Then lay the divided card thus,</p>

<table align="center" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" summary="triangles">
	<tr>
		<td width="388">
			<img src="images/triangles.jpg" alt="triangles">
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>and say, <b>"I want you to take these two pieces</b> (touching the two
triangles) <b>and put them together so they will look exactly like this"</b>
(pointing to rectangle). If S. hesitates, repeat instructions with a
little urging. If first attempt is a failure, replace pieces, saying,
<b>"No; put them together so they will look like this"</b> (pointing to
rectangle). Do not suggest further by face or word whether response
is correct. If a piece is turned over, turn it back and don't count
that trial. Give, if necessary, three trials of one minute each.</p>

<p>Credit if two of the three trials are successful.</p>
<br>

<p><b>6. <i>Three Commissions</i></b></p>

<p>Take S. to center of room. Say, <b>"Now, I want you to do something for
me. Here's a key. I want you to put it on that chair over there; then
I want you to shut</b> (or <b>open</b>) <b>that door, and then bring me the box
which you see over there"</b> (pointing in turn to the objects
designated). <b>"Do you understand? Be sure to get it right. First, put
the key on the chair, then shut</b> (or <b>open</b>) <b>the door, then bring me the
box</b> (again pointing). <b>Go ahead."</b> Stress words <b>first</b> and <b>then.</b> Give no
further aid.</p>

<p>Credit if the three commissions are executed in proper order.</p>

error, repeat whole test, using <b>left hand, right ear, left eye.</b> Avoid
giving aid in any way.</p>

<p>Credit if three of three, or five of six responses are correct.</p>
<br>

<p><b>2. <i>Missing Parts</i></b></p>

<p>Show card (VI 2) and say, <b>"There is something wrong with this face.
It is not all there. Part of it is left out. Look carefully and tell
me what part of the face is not there."</b> Same for (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). If
S. gives irrelevant answer, say, <b>"No; I am talking about the face.
Look again and tell me what is left out of the face."</b> If correct
response does not follow, point to the place where eye should be and
say, <b>"See, the eye is gone."</b> Then proceed to others, asking, <b>"What is
left out of this face?"</b> For (<i>d</i>) say, <b>"What is left out of this
picture?"</b> No help except on (<i>a</i>). Order is eyes, mouth, nose, arms.</p>

<p>Credit if correct response is made for three of four pictures.</p>
<br>

<p><b>3. <i>Counting Thirteen Pennies</i></b></p>

<p>Place thirteen pennies in horizontal row. Say, <b>"See these pennies.
Count them and tell me how many there are. Count them with your
finger, this way"</b> (pointing to the first one on the subject's
left)&mdash;<b>"One. Now, go ahead."</b> If S. gives number without pointing,
say, <b>"No, count them with your finger, this way,"</b> starting him as
before. Have S. count aloud. Second trial given if only minor mistake
is made.</p>

I want you to say it over just as I do. Understand? Listen carefully
and be sure to say exactly what I say."</b> Repeat, <b>"say exactly what I
say,"</b> before reading each sentence. Do not re-read any sentence.</p>

out: "What fools those fellows are to be trudging along on foot when
one of them might be riding." The old man, hearing this, made his son
get on the donkey, while he himself walked. Soon they came upon some
men. "Look," said one of them, "see that lazy boy riding while his
old father has to walk." On hearing this the miller made his son get
off, and he climbed upon the donkey himself. Farther on they met a
company of women, who shouted out: "Why, you lazy old fellow, to ride
along so comfortably while your poor boy there can hardly keep pace
by the side of you!" And so the good-natured miller took his boy up
behind him and both of them rode. As they came to the town a citizen
said to them, "Why, you cruel fellows! You two are better able to
carry the poor little donkey than he is to carry you." "Very well,"
said the miller, "we will try." So both of them jumped to the ground,
got some ropes, tied the donkey's legs to a pole and tried to carry
him. But as they crossed the bridge the donkey became frightened,
kicked loose, and fell into the stream.</p>

<p><b>2. <i>Induction Test</i></b></p>

<p>(If XVIII 2 is to be given, it should precede this test.) Provide six
sheets of tissue paper, 8&frac12; by 11 inches. Take the first sheet, and
telling S. to watch what you do, fold it once, and in the middle of
the folded edge cut out a small notch; then ask S. to tell you <b>how
many holes there will be in the paper when it is unfolded. Whatever
the answer,</b> unfold the paper and hold it up broadside for S.'s
inspection. Next, take another sheet, fold it once as before and say,
<b>"Now, when we folded it this way and cut out a piece, you remember it
made one hole in the paper. This time we will give the paper another
fold and see how many holes we shall have."</b> Then proceed to fold the
paper again, this time in the other direction, cut out a piece from
the folded side, and ask <b>how many holes there will be when the paper
is unfolded.</b> Then unfold the paper, hold it up before S. so as to let
him see the result. Whatever the answer, proceed with the third
sheet. Fold it once and say, <b>"When we folded it this way there was
one hole."</b> Fold it again and say, <b>"And when we folded it this way
there were two holes."</b> Fold the paper a third time and say, <b>"Now, I
am folding it again. How many holes will it have this time when I
unfold it?"</b> Again unfold paper while S. looks on. Continue in the
same manner with sheets four, five, and six, adding one fold each
time. In folding each sheet recapitulate results, saying (with the
sixth, for example): <b>"When we folded it this way there was one hole;
when we folded it again there were two; when we folded it again there
were four; when we folded it again there were eight; when we folded
it again there were sixteen; now tell me how many holes there will be
if we fold it once more."</b> Avoid saying, "When we folded it once,
twice, three times." After sixth response, ask, <b>"Can you tell me a
rule by which I could know each time how many holes there are going
to be?"</b></p>

(pointing). <b>Look again and you will see that the second diagram is
just like the first, except that each letter has a dot with it, and
that the last diagram is like the third except that here, also, each
letter has a dot. Now, all of this represents a code; that is, a
secret language. It is a real code, one that was used in the Civil
War for sending secret messages. This is the way it works: We draw
the lines which hold a letter, but leave out the letter. Here, for
example, is the way we would write 'spy.'"</b> Then write the words <b>"spy"</b>
and <b>"trench,"</b> pointing out carefully where each letter comes from,
and emphasizing the fact that the dot must be used in addition to the
lines in writing any letter in the second or fourth diagram. Then
add: <b>"I am going to have you write something for me; remember, now,
how the letters go, first</b> (pointing, as before) <b>a b c, d e f, g h i,
then j k l, m n o, p q r, then s t u v, then w x y z. And don't

(pointing). At this point, take away the diagrams, give S. pencil and
paper, and tell him to write the words <b>"come quickly."</b> Say nothing
about hurrying. Do not permit S. to reproduce the code and then to
copy the code letters from his reproduction.</p>

and the short line represents a cannon. The cannon is pointed
horizontally</b> (<b>on a level</b>) <b>and is fired across this perfectly level
field."</b> After it is clear that these conditions of the problem are
comprehended, add, <b>"Now, suppose that this cannon is fired off and
that the ball comes to the ground at this point here</b> (pointing to the
farther end of the line which represents the field). <b>Take this pencil
and draw a line which will show what path the cannon ball will take
from the time it leaves the mouth of the cannon till it strikes the
ground."</b></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Say, <b>"You know, of course, that water holds up a fish that is

is partly full of water. We place the bucket on the scales and find
that with the water in it it weighs exactly 45 pounds. Then we put a
5-pound fish into the bucket of water. Now, what will the whole thing
weigh?"</b> If S. responds correctly, say, <b>"How can this be correct,
since the water itself holds up the fish?"</b></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>"You know, do you not, what it means when they say a gun
'carries 100 yards?' It means that the bullet goes 100 yards before
it drops to amount to anything."</b> When this is clear, proceed, <b>"Now,
suppose a man is shooting at a mark about the size of a quart can.
His rifle carries perfectly more than 100 yards. With such a gun is
it any harder to hit the mark at 100 yards than it is at 50 yards?"</b></p>

vessel to another, but if S. asks whether this is permissible, say
<b>"yes."</b> If S. has not solved (<i>a</i>) correctly within five minutes,
explain the solution in full and proceed to (<i>b</i>). State (<i>b</i>) orally
and allow S. five minutes for its solution. Do not explain in case of

<p>A definition is satisfactory if it gives one correct meaning for the
word, regardless of whether that meaning is the most common one, and
however poorly it may be expressed. (See <i>The Measurement of
Intelligence,</i> pp. 227-28, for illustrations of satisfactory and
unsatisfactory responses.)</p>

<p>Time may be saved, with little loss of accuracy, by giving one list
only, and in this case list 1 should be used. The standards required
for passing are as follows:</p>
